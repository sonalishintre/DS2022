Hello all!

This is a project that was made with the purpose of teaching you how to import custom modules.

The notebook that will be due as submission is week-07-class-03-lab.ipynb. It has a bunch of errors because of the import statements! Can you fix these so that the notebook will run?

The structure of this project is as such:

There are four main files that hold different math operations: add_two_numbers.py, subtract_two_numbers.py, divide_two_numbers.py, and multiply_two_numbers.py. Within each file, there are functions created to operate on two different numbers passed in. We want to import these functions from our files to our main working script (week-07-class-03-lab.ipynb) in order to utilize them in our code.

The python notebook obviously has errors in it. The bulk of the code will work fine as-is, as long as the import statements are corrected.

Hint: make sure you keep an eye on the project structure, names of functions, and names of files. Not all files are in the same part of the directory tree!
